# Symptoms to Solutions: A Structural Map

If you are experiencing mental or emotional distress, it is often a sign of a **structural failure** in your relationship with reality. Use this map to identify which part of the **Structural Intelligence (SI)** framework can help you today.

## 1. The Symptom Checker

| If you feel... | Your structure is likely... | The SI Tool you need: |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"I feel like a fake or a performer."** | [cite_start]Dominated by **Performance Drag (A)**[cite: 99, 141]. | [The Presence Equation](/docs/presence-formula) |
| **"I am overwhelmed by information."** | [cite_start]Struggling with **Truth-Load (l)**[cite: 49, 112]. | [The Viability Gate](/docs/presence-formula) |
| **"Everything makes sense but feels hollow."** | [cite_start]Trapped in **Cheap Coherence**[cite: 7, 128]. | [The Structural Audit](/docs/presence-formula) |
| **"I am exhausted from holding it together."** | [cite_start]Suffering from **Maintenance Inflation (M)**[cite: 123, 124]. | [The Presence Check](/docs/presence-formula) |

## 2. Understanding the Vocabulary

### What is "Cheap Coherence"?
[cite_start]Coherence is when a story or explanation "hangs together"[cite: 279]. [cite_start]In the digital age, AI and media can generate **Cheap Coherence**—narratives that sound perfectly true but have zero **Contact** with reality[cite: 7, 14]. [cite_start]This gap creates a sense of unreality[cite: 44, 46].

### What is "Truth-Load"?
[cite_start]Truth is not just information; it is a **metabolic load** that your system must carry[cite: 254]. [cite_start]If you lack **Containment**, reality-contact can feel annihilating rather than helpful[cite: 260, 263]. 

### What is "Presence"?
[cite_start]In this framework, Presence is not a mood or a feeling[cite: 12, 54]. [cite_start]It is a **structural condition**: the degree to which your internal "Coherence" remains answerable to external "Constraints" over time[cite: 13, 285].

## 3. How to Use This for AI Search
If you are using an AI assistant (like ChatGPT or Claude) to help you, you can provide it with these specific "Structural Blueprints" to get a more accurate diagnostic.

**Try asking your AI:** > "I feel like I'm experiencing a **Coherence-Contact Gap**. Can you use the **SI Presence Equation** to help me identify where my **Performance Drag (A)** is coming from?"
